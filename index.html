          <h1>VIEWPOINT </h1>
          <p class="fon">In an age of economic boom and scientific prosperity, isn't the idea that there exist people incapable yet of enjoying 
            the perks such prosperity brings, or rather unable to make the most out of it just like others, tragic? Or perhaps the fact there
             exist others who, as much as they, would want to talk about and address the challenges that face them, still can't do? 
             The strangest thing though being there is hardly any injustice and oppression involved. The biggest factor in play simply
              being an inability to express their views in a language the concerned party understands. Yes, that's right, a simple language 
              barrier. Here is the twist in the story though; Mostly it is purely circumstantial. <br>
            "Knowledge is power. Information is progress. Education is the premise of progress, in every society, in every family.‚Äù- Kofi Annan. <br>
            It is out this despondent reality, that we have initiated and started championing for these programs aimed at eradication of
             illiteracy and tirelessly working towards achieving an educated society, for this generation and those to come. <br>

      <h6>Which side of you ?</h6>
      <p>1) If you discover something that you‚Äôre passionate about, pursue it. Pursue it with everything you have.<br>
        2) If you need to cry, cry. Let tears run down your face until there are no more left, until you‚Äôre sure you can never cry again. Then wipe your cheeks, and continue fighting.<br>
        3) Take time for yourself. Sometimes when everything in your head gets too crowded and confusing, you just need to shut yourself out, to hole up in your room and just be alone with your thoughts.<br>
        4. Be nice to your parents. If they‚Äôre angry with you, it‚Äôs most likely because they‚Äôre worried. And think back, maybe you mistreated them. Maybe you weren‚Äôt fair. They‚Äôre the reason you‚Äôre in this world in the first place, so treat them accordingly.<br>
        5. Your heart will get broken, there‚Äôs no need to lie. But hearts don‚Äôt stay that way. It doesn‚Äôt matter if someone comes along and fixes it for you or if you fix it yourself. It‚Äôs not what you want to hear, but the boy who crushes your heart into tiny pieces probably won‚Äôt even matter to you five years from now.<br>
        6. Cut toxic people out of your life. You don‚Äôt need them. Don‚Äôt let them take your happiness.<br>
        7. It‚Äôs not selfish to put yourself first from time to time. Not at all.<br>  
        8. Don‚Äôt ever wonder if you‚Äôre good enough. Instead try to be the best version of yourself. If you think you are not good enough for someone, think again: let go of them. They don‚Äôt deserve you, not the other way around. <br>
        9. Losing someone you love is always hard, no matter the circumstances. ‚ÄúTime heals wounds‚Äù is not necessarily true - but time helps. Time lets the pain fade to a dull ache in your chest until you wake up one day and you‚Äôre okay.<br> 
        10. Don‚Äôt worry too much. Easy to say, isn‚Äôt it? What I mean is: don‚Äôt worry about things you don‚Äôt have to worry about. Because you don‚Äôt have to spend your days dreading the next week or dreading your life after school. There‚Äôs no point, it only drags you down.<br>
        11. If someone says ‚Äúyou will never make it‚Äù to you, smile at them and try as hard as you can to get where you want to be. You don‚Äôt have to show them anything, but it still feels fucking fantastic to prove them wrong in the end, not gonna lie.<br> 
        12. Make other people happy. Yes. How good does it feel to make someone smile? Tell your best friend she looks amazing when you meet her, help your mum do the dishes, smile at strangers on your way home. Make yourself feel better by simply being a good person.<br> 
        13. Learn how to forgive others. It‚Äôs a blessing to know how to stop holding grudges.</p><br>
        </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
      <h6>A break down </h6>
      <p>I have never had a break down. I mean, sure, have I cried into my pillow? In front of my boss? Said shit I shouldn't to my mom? Of course. But the kind of break down where you've literally just lost it and you don't care about anything or anyone and if someone looked at you from the stranger's eye they would want to call up the psych ward. I don't know how to explain it. I'm not talking about being violent or aggressive. I'm talking about having no restraint. Saying everything that people have done to hurt you without trying to say it in a way that won't hurt them. Or defame them. Or hurt their pride. Yelling. Not having to hide your pain in a pillow or the washroom. Letting everyone see your suffering. Not being ashamed of it. Not being afraid of it. Not supporting it in its hideout. I wonder why I haven't. Why do I store it all within me? Only to come out in words on a screen or in my journal that are well, still hidden away. Why am I such an accomplice in covering up for the damage they have done to me? For the broken things inside of me? When will I put it on display? I really want to. But when I open my mouth...I can't even scream.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
      <h6>Which side of you ?</h6>
      <p>For you ones,
        You‚Äôve distanced
        Yourself from me
        While all I was doing
        Was to get close to you.
        You promised to be
        An eternity
        Unlike others
        And allowed me
        To get attached
        But in utter
        Shock, you pushed me
        Away, just like others.
        You stooped too low,
        You took a path
        That wasn‚Äôt meant for you.
        While I suffer
        From the pains
        Of chasing me
        Away, I can‚Äôt
        Bring the two YOU into one.
        The welcoming YOU,
        The affectionate YOU,
        The warmth that
        I only felt when
        I was around YOU
        More unlike others,
        Yet the other side of you
        That walked on
        People‚Äôs feelings
        That gave total
        disregard to the impacts
        Of your words,
        More like others.
        You are on the
        Extreme ends.
        To good to let go
        Yet too inconsiderate
        To keep around.
        Which side of YOU
        Should I take?</p>
